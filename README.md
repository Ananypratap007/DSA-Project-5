## Features
- Elegant Pseudo Code Generation: This project leverages the power of C++ to elegantly transform intricate flowcharts into clean and human-readable pseudo code.

- Node Representation: Utilizing a custom Node class, this converter is capable of representing complex flowchart nodes with attributes such as node number, type (e.g., START, END, IF, BLOCK), and text content within the node.

- Stack-Based Conversion: The converter employs a stack-based approach to handle complex flowchart structures, making it suitable for flowcharts with nested conditionals and branching.

- Use of Adjacency List: To efficiently traverse the flowchart, an adjacency list is utilized to represent the connections between nodes, ensuring optimized performance even for large flowcharts.

- Professional Documentation: The code is well-documented and follows best coding practices, making it easy for developers to understand and extend for custom use cases.

## Getting Started
To begin using the Flowchart to Pseudo Code Converter, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flowchart-to-pseudo-code-converter.git
```
2. Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler like g++:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o flowchart_converter
```

3. Run the executable:

```bash
./flowchart_converter
```

## Usage
The usage of the converter is straightforward:

1. Input the number of nodes in the flowchart.

2. Input the details for each node, including the node number, type (START, END, IF, BLOCK), and text content within the node.

3. Provide the adjacency list representation of the flowchart to establish connections between nodes.

4. The converter will generate human-readable pseudo code, displaying the converted output.


## Examples
### Example 1: Simple Flowchart
Let's consider a simple use case where the input flowchart consists of a linear sequence of nodes, representing a basic algorithm:
``` 
Number of nodes: 4
1: START node
2: BLOCK node - Initialize variables
3: BLOCK node - Perform calculations
4: END node
AdjList:
0:
1: 2
2: 3
3: 4
```
Pseudo Code Output:

``` pseudo
start
Initialize variables
Perform calculations
end
```

### Example 2: Complex Flowchart with Conditional Branching
In a more complex scenario, the converter can handle conditional branching using IF and ELSE structures:

```
Number of nodes: 6
1: START node
2: IF node - (x > 0)
3: BLOCK node - Perform action when true
4: BLOCK node - Perform action when false
5: END node
6: BLOCK node - Final action
AdjList:
0:
1: 2 4
2: 3 4
3: 5
4: 5
5: 6
```
Pseudo Code Output:

```
start
if (x > 0)
{
  Perform action when true
}
else
{
  Perform action when false
}
end
Final action
```
